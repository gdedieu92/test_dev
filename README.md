#Refactor this code full to Object Oriented
#Consider the single responsability of SOLID principles to make the refactor
#The test has to pass (already pass in the code provided)
#If you detect bugs in the algorithm of databases is a plus
#If you detect a simpler way to achieve the same result is a plus 

#Let's code a bit :)
